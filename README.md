# Ignited-Horizon

Welcome to Ignited Horizon
                                                  A site that is dedicated to helping students about different projects.


              I love good content, smart marketing, and creative researches. I am a journalist and a speaker. Every single project on my site is free. Mainly, I created the site for university students to help them create creative contents and to get ideas of different researchers. I consider myself a ‘Forever Student,’ eager to both build an academic foundation and professional platform and stay in tune with the latest trends, digital marketing strategies through continuous coursework.


How it all started

          Back in 2012, I stumbled upon an article about “Blogging”. Knowingly or unknowingly I pictured myself as a blogger. May be a long time ago,  I was practicing a very amateur blogging secretly inside me which directed me to the personal blogging site later. Now I have a couple of blog sites. Although my plans rarely come to fruition, serendipity has been good to me.
